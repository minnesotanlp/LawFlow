They had informally used the trailer to sell coffee products on campus, but would like to see if they could form a real business. The key to their popularity has been A’s importation of Hawaiian coffee beans, which help the trio brew delicious coffee drinks but has proven to be an expensive business decision. If they form an entity, they might want to see whether they could have investors supply some extra money to help them cover the cost of importing the beans. They would plan on giving the investors some kind of profit interest in the business in exchange for their help, but aren’t too familiar with how that would work.\n",

        "In addition, this venture has largely been A’s project. B and C aren’t quite as invested, as they have more time-consuming careers of their own. The group’s other friends, D and E, however, have kept in touch with A and have expressed interest in joining the business in place of B and C. B and C might be open to this as well, but will need some time to think. A must also later decide if he wants anyone involved with the business to be able to come and go as they please, or if he wants a firmer commitment from anyone involved with the truck (either B and C or D and E) to devote more of their time and resources to it.\n",

Aside from E’s own capital, the organization’s initial funding is planned to be provided from contributions from community members, and any work at future events will be done by volunteers. E does not seek to profit off of this endeavor, and does not want to report additional income from any registration proceeds or donations—or risk not reporting it—on his personal tax return. If the business incorporates, E would seek to add F, G, and H to its board of directors. If the organization grows as planned, E would seek to hire a handful of full- or part-time employees to handle marketing, event organization, and other administrative work.\n",

They seek to teach fishing skills—ranging from basic to advanced—to both children and adults, through events held at parks, lakes, and rivers nearby. They envision weekly or monthly workshops where they educate participants on a particular skill—casting, knot tying, fish landing with a net, and more. Signup for the workshops is free. A and B encourage participants to bring their own fishing gear, but plan on contracting with a local sporting goods store to purchase bulk orders of tackle at a discounted rate. Because of that, they have decided to explore forming a business entity.\n",

They would like, however, to minimize any formalities associated with owning a business. In addition, they would like to raffle off fishing apparel at some of the workshops, and are ok using their own money to buy these items for the first few instances. If their workshops are popular and they consistently have high attendance, they would like to borrow money or obtain outside funding to keep this practice up.\n",

It is in relatively good shape, but would benefit from a handful of basic renovations. M and A will cook breakfasts, provide housekeeping services, and lead hikes for guests in the surrounding area. They will also provide kayaks, stand up paddleboards, and jet skis for rent, all of which are personally owned by the couple. They have a sufficient (i.e. covering everything) liability waiver in place which guests agree to upon booking their stay. Per an informal agreement, M and A have also received some funding from the nearby town’s chamber of commerce in exchange for recommending other local businesses to their guests. They’re interested in forming a business to separate their personal assets from that of the business.\n",

A and B have had excellent results growing their own plants with the soil, but need additional funding to produce an amount that’s large enough to be tested on a greater scale—and which would ultimately help indicate whether they could form a viable business. A and B’s friend C has an eye for promising business ideas. She knows the two have a strong work ethic and believes that the soil will be a success if the two can consistently produce enough of it to meet demands of early testers. C is willing to invest $2M for a 30% ownership interest, which A and B agree to. If all goes well, the three would like to sell the soil’s chemical composition to a biotech company.

In addition to the normal rentals, P has two other potential uses associated with the building. One is a regularly-occurring food truck fair that will feature local, newly-formed food trucks. It will take place on the building’s property, in its parking lot. The second is a temporary restaurant featuring one of P’s former business partners (B) who has become a chef. The restaurant will have the exclusive use of the space for ten weeks of the subsequent summer, and will be a collaborative effort between the two entities.

The work is mostly done in his home, and varies based on how much equipment he has at a given time. He’s considering implementing the option of selling the resale equipment to a local hockey equipment store, mostly depending on if he keeps getting a supply of broken sticks—the piece of equipment most common on the resale market. Though buyers at these stores are aware of the potential defects of a refurbished hockey stick, the stores selling them generally provide no warranty on them, effectively relieving them of liability. L is confident—and correct—that there are no huge liability risks associated with selling refurbished sticks, but might want some protection—as well as a more official entity—to do business with the stores, and the consumers he sells to on the side.\n",

C will be contributing all of the labor to running the new entity, including hiring support staff, scheduling appointments for the doctors, etc. The three have identified a suitable location for the new practice and may either purchase or lease it long-term depending on how the negotiations go. During the conversation, it should become clear that C expects an equal share of the new entity and is also worried about having decision-making power after formation. C does not have as much money to contribute as the doctors do and will be contributing mostly labor. A and B are somewhat dismissive of C’s value and expect to be “running the show” themselves because of their extensive training as doctors, etc. They find C indispensable, but not necessarily worthy of equal ownership in the new entity.\n",
