A started the business as a sole proprietorship with B as a part-time employee, but would like to expand the business after realizing it will be a profitable venture. A wants to add B to the venture, where the two will share management control over most aspects of the business—including its hours of operation, employee hiring, and other logistics. Exclusively within A’s discretion, though, are: a) the final say on whether any additional members are added to the business; and b) the decision of whether to reinvest profits into the business’s growth or pay distributions to the business’s managers. The trailer is A’s personal property, and it is transported by a truck that B recently acquired for business use. A and B have two full-time employees—neither with an ownership interest in the business—and are considering hiring three other part-time employees. The trailer moves weekly, but most weeks it operates outside a small community center. A and B have an informal agreement with the community to operate there, but would like to memorialize this arrangement. If business continues to do well, A and B would be interested in moving their operations to a brick-and-mortar location.\n",

Soon, their customers are asking for more products and spreading word of the brand to other people they know, as it’s proven to be a huge success. H and W establish a website from which their brand’s products can be ordered, and devote more of their free time to running the business out of their home. They now have a full-time online apparel store, ship to customers in multiple states, and are even considering forming a youth travel baseball team for their son and his friends, under the same brand as the clothing lines. W will be primarily responsible for the entity and will have final say on most decisions; H will have secondary influence. Both have personal property used in the business: W, an embroidery machine and screen printer; H, a pickup truck used for work around the family’s farm but also used for transporting products to and from tournaments, as well as transporting materials (fabric, designs, etc.) purchased at wholesale before being created into baseball apparel products.\n",

The product is a single-use, disposable phone charger which can be recycled and reused by their company after a short re-charging. The chargers’ incredible efficiency is powered by a discovery that B made, and which the two have not been able to find evidence of elsewhere after consulting extensive scientific literature. A and B have agreed to keep this discovery a secret until they have a more established business plan. For now, they plan on making these chargers available at sporting events, concerts, and similar events. There are not currently any investors in the company. However, A and B would like to raise capital, grow the business by striking partnerships with event venues, and eventually either sell their product on the market, or their current entity to a larger company. They would like to add their friend C, an expert in marketing and sales, to the business, and have C be the point of contact with event venues in the five surrounding states (including their current home state). If all goes well, they would like to begin shipping the product in bulk as well.\n",

        "L operates a flower shop from her own immense garden. She sells flowers at her local farmers’ market, ships custom bouquets both locally and regionally via online order, and provides arrangements for other local businesses. While L has no trouble operating the business like a true business, she still feels she is enjoying a hobby growing and selling flowers—and a successful one at that. Overall she makes a solid profit, mainly from her local flower sales. The regional/online business, though, breaks even and in some years operates at a slight loss due to the expenses and preparation associated with keeping flowers in pristine condition via shipping. L has considered using an e-commerce site to boost regional exposure, but has also considered limiting her shop to local business. Profit would not be a concern as other neighboring towns have expressed their interest in her products.

A and B’s friend C has an eye for promising business ideas. She knows the two have a strong work ethic and believes that the soil will be a success if the two can consistently produce enough of it to meet demands of early testers. C is willing to invest $2M for a 30% ownership interest, which A and B agree to. If all goes well, the three would like to sell the soil’s chemical composition to a biotech company. A and B stay current with the industry and know that they have made a quiet breakthrough with the soil, which is a sought-after product by a number of companies.\n",

        "5.Title: Fishing Education\n",
        "Context:\n",
        "A and B are each avid anglers and seek to grow the sport within their area, which is largely urban. They seek to teach fishing skills—ranging from basic to advanced—to both children and adults, through events held at parks, lakes, and rivers nearby. They envision weekly or monthly workshops where they educate participants on a particular skill—casting, knot tying, fish landing with a net, and more. Signup for the workshops is free. A and B encourage participants to bring their own fishing gear, but plan on contracting with a local sporting goods store to purchase bulk orders of tackle at a discounted rate. Because of that, they have decided to explore forming a business entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Neither A nor B are particularly familiar with small business structure or ownership, and don’t seek to profit from the business. They would like, however, to minimize any formalities associated with owning a business. In addition, they would like to raffle off fishing apparel at some of the workshops, and are ok using their own money to buy these items for the first few instances. If their workshops are popular and they consistently have high attendance, they would like to borrow money or obtain outside funding to keep this practice up.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, they want to learn more about the function of any documents used to start the business, and potentially review anything that’s written for them before they officially get to work.\n",

The human diagram is structured around initial fact-gathering, filing forms, drafting an operating agreement, and addressing tax treatment. Although there is substantial overlap, some points (like local permitting or seeking financing) do not appear in the human diagram and are marked as \"Unmapped\", while others are only loosely matched where the human diagram describes the underlying task in less detail. Both diagrams ultimately cover similar pillars of entity setup: gathering client information, deciding on entity structure, drafting foundational documents, and ensuring compliance.  \n",
